# What is Build Bible?

Simply put, a curated collection of information for most popular project car platforms.

As anyone who has ever owned a project car will tell you, there's nothing more frustrating than not being able to find the information you need, when you need it. Sure, there are dedicated internet forums for nearly every platform imaginable these days, but in many cases, finding what you're looking for on these websites is akin to the proverbial "needle in the haystack". How many fruitless hours have you spent sifting through a decades-old forum thread, only to find the topic leading nowhere and no relevant information being shared?

Yeah, us too.

This is where Build Bible steps in. We collect the information you may need, store it in one massive, searchable database, and present it in a cohesive, logical format so you can spend more time finishing your project and less time digging through the mess!

# Back-end

Build Bible is a Django application at its core. It was originally built in Flask, but as future aspirations piled up, it quickly became apparent that a more robust framework was required to get the project up and running in a reasonable ammount of time, and with fewer bugs to fix. 

# Front-end

Build Bible's core style is derrived from the PureCSS framework. From there, plenty of custom SASS was written to make its style something truely unique, yet responsive.

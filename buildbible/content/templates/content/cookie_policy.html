    <h2 class="content-subhead text-primary">What Are Cookies?</h2>
    <p>
        As is common practice with almost all professional websites, this site uses cookies, which are tiny files that are
        downloaded to your computer to improve your experience. This page describes what information they gather, how
        we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies
        from being stored, however, this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the sites functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more general information on cookies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">see the Wikipedia article on HTTP Cookies</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 class="content-subhead text-primary">How We Use Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately in most cases there are no
        industry-standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features
        they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need
        them or not, in case they are used to provide a service that you use.
    </p>
    <h2 class="content-subhead text-primary">Disabling Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser's Help menu
        for how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other
        websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and
        features of this site. Therefore it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Account related cookies</p>
            <p>
                If you create an account with us then we will use cookies for the management of the signup process and
                general administration. These cookies will usually be deleted when you log out, however, in some cases
                they may remain afterwards to remember your site preferences when logged out.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Login related cookies</p>
            <p>
                We use cookies when you are logged in so that we can remember this fact. This prevents you from having to
                log in every single time you visit a new page. These cookies are typically removed or cleared when you log
                out to ensure that you can only access restricted features and areas when logged in.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Forms related cookies</p>
            <p>
                When you submit data through a form such as those found on contact pages or comment forms cookies may
                be set to remember your user details for future correspondence.

                we need to set cookies so that this information can be called whenever you interact with a page that is
                affected by your preferences.

        Hopefully this has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned, if there is something that you aren't
